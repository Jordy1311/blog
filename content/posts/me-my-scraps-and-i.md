I have a shit memory, I easily become a bit lazy, but I’m trying to be better!

To improve my technical development, I’m starting a blog… It’s the obvious decision: I’m almost 30, and not into the social media of *my* time, and **definitely** not into the social media of today! That leaves the good ol' format of text on a lightly styled HTML document. The way the web should have stayed, I reckon…

#### My goals are simple:
- Make time for deep dives on interests and write about them.
- Post semi-regularly (*but I’m not scheduling this…*).
- Build a nice long blog of deep dives.
- Have some fun while doing it.

#### The types of things I'm interested in:
- Small yet powerful tools.
- Ridiculous but genius ideas.
- Questioning the status quo.
- Minimalism.
- The footprint of the internet. 

#### Generally, I’ll aim to keep things:
- Lean - *without waffle*
- Grounded - *I’m just an average guy with an interest in most things tech*
- Light-hearted

I will never use AI to generate these posts. Maybe the titles because I lack creativity but never the content!

I'm writing this like I know it will get a following… I don’t know and it probably won’t, but screw it, I’m carving out a piece of the internet for me and my scraps!
